  <h1>AutoRiaDataParser</h1>

<div align="justify">
The script automatically collects and processes data necessary for analyzing data about cars and sellers posted on the website <a href="https://auto.ria.com/"> AutoRia</a>.

<br>

ðŸ“Œ **Operating principle:**

Page analysis and data collection is performed using *Selenium* and *BeautifulSoup*. Links are collected and checked for uniqueness relative to the current date, after which they are saved to the database, excluding duplicates. Each unique URL is processed to extract information about cars and sellers. The data is saved to the database and updated as needed.

ðŸ“Œ **Advantages of use:**

â€¢ *Automation:* Eliminates the need for manual analysis of a large number of pages and ads.  
â€¢ *Time saving:* Fast data collection using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.  
â€¢ *Flexibility:* The script can be configured to work with any section of the AutoRia website and any search parameters by substituting the appropriate link.  
â€¢ *Data relevance:* Information can be updated daily, and old records can be additionally analyzed relative to new ones.  
â€¢ *Analytics:* The collected data allows for an in-depth analysis of the car market.
